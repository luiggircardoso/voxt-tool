Voxt tool is a small app that is made with PNGTubbing in mind.

> [!WARNING]  
> You will need a functional microphone for this. 

## How does it work?

Using two PNGs of your choosing, it can make the bridge for you to use them as an actual webcam in OBS. If you click Ctrl+Space the Show Mode will be on and you'll be able to add it as an element using the Window Capture element in OBS with the Chroma Key filter. 

## How to Test

1. Get two different PNGs
2. Install the app in Releases
3. In the App, apply these two by clicking "Add Sprite" and selecting a PNG
4. Please certify you have a functioning microphone
5. Set the state of one of them to talking and see the magic!
